# Certificate Generator

## Steps
1. Initialise a python virtual env environment (Recommended but optional)
2. Install dependencies by using command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Updates `names.csv` or upload one yourself with the exact same file name.
4. Upload an image of your choice that represents your certificate
5. Change the necessary parameters in `main.py` (Note that y-axis position would require you to use Paint to get the pixel required).
6. Upload fonts where necessary under the `fonts` folder.
7. At the project's root directory, you will need to run the command `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` based on your python version
8. You should be able to see your generated certificates under `certificates/<your-certificate>.pdf`
